# STM32-DHT11-LCD
This project involves interfacing an STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller to a DHT11 sensor module and a 16x2 LCD Display for real-time recording of temperature and humidity.
The main components used in the setup are:
- STM32 Blue Pill Development Board
- DHT11 Sensor module
- 16x2 LCD Display
- USB to TTL Serial Converter module -> for debugging the STM32 MCU
- 10K Potentiometer -> for varying the contrast on the LCD Display
